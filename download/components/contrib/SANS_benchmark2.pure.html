<H1>The <CODE>SANS_benchmark2</CODE> Component</H1>

Henrich Frielinghaus
Several benchmark SANS samples are defined in this routine. The first ones are analytically defined. Higher numbers are forseen for tables.
In principle, the exact definitions can be changed freely - inside this code.
The consideration of all parameters as a routine parameter would be too much for the general purpose.
The user might decide to make single parameters routine parameters.
For the scattering simulation a high fraction of neutron paths is directed to the scattering (exact fraction is sc_aim).
The remaining paths are used for the transmitted beams. The absolute intensities are treated accordingly, and the p-parameter is set accordingly.
For the scattering probability, the integral of the scattering function between Q = 0.0001 and 1.0 AA-1 is calculated.
This is used in terms of transmisson, and of course for the scattering probability.
In this way, multiple scattering processes could be treated as well.
The typical SANS range was considered to be between 0.0001 and 1.0 AA-1.
This means that the scattered neutrons are equally distributed in this range on logarithmic Q-scales.
The Q-parameters can be changed still inside the code, if needed.
