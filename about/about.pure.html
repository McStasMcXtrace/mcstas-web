<h1>McStas - Monte Carlo simulation of neutron instruments</h1>
McStas is an ongoing project to create a general tool for simulating
neutron
scattering instruments. The project is a collaboration between DTU
Physics (formerly RIS&Oslash; DTU and RIS&Oslash; Natnl. Lab),
University of Copenhagen, Paul Scherrer Institute and Institut
Laue-Langevin.
<p>The Ris&oslash; efforts have historically
been <a href="funding/">funded</a> through multiple <a href="funding/">EU
programs</a>.
<p>The software is freely available and can be <a href="/download/">downloaded</a>
from this site.
</p>
<p>McStas is based on a compiler that reads a high-level specification
language defining the instrument to be simulated and produces C code
that
performs the Monte Carlo Simulation. The system is very fast in use,
both
when setting up the instrument definition and when doing calculations.
Typical figures are 500000 neutron histories per second on a fast
PC.
</p>
<p>McStas supports triple-axis,&nbsp; time-of-flight instruments, and
polarised
neutrons. It comes with a comprehensive manual and a library of
well-tested
components that include most standard elements of neutron scattering
instruments,
including steady-state and pulsed sources, monochromators/analysers,
guides,
collimators, vanadium and powder samples, velocity selectors and
choppers,
and a variety of detectors. <br>
</p>
<p>McStas has been found to run on all existing computer systems
(Unix/Linux, Windows, MacOS). Please refer to the <a
 href="/developments/platforms/">platform</a> requirements and tests
page.<br>
